# FX-Trader-Agent-Env-trainer-WFS-RL----MLP-PPO-MCP-entegrated
PyTorch RL framework with an MLP Actor-Critic trained via PPO. Uses a rolling walk-forward window (10 train/1 test), rolling Z-score outlier detection, mathematical candlestick pattern matching, a gated encoder, an MCP market interface, and evaluation with greedy, stochastic, temperature, and epsilon tests using confusion matrices.
